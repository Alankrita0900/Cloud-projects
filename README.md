Hi! I'm an MCA 2024 graduate and aspiring Cloud Engineer.  
I am currently learning AWS and building projects step by step.  

### 🚀 What I will upload here:
- AWS cloud projects (VPC, EC2, S3, RDS, etc.)
- Architecture diagrams
- DevOps practice (Git, Linux, CI/CD – later)
- Notes & learning progress

Stay tuned — projects coming soon! 😊
